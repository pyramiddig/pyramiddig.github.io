{"name":"Pyramiddig.github.io","tagline":"API Documentation Test","body":"##Overview\r\nThe International Trade Administration (ITA) within the Department of Commerce (DOC) offers access to their public data via an Application Program Interface (API).  The API allows developers to create new and innovative applications for the web or mobile devices by mashing it with other trade-related data.\r\n\r\nITA provides information that is specifically targeted to businesses that are interested in exporting their products and services overseas.  For example, the API includes Trade Events that businesses may be interested in attending and Trade Information Articles that provide insight into the current exporting environment.  Developers who work with trade and exporting information will find this information particularly useful as it originates from an authoritative, federal government source.\r\n\r\nUse of the ITA APIs and other data is free of charge, but developers must register with ITA to receive a development key and agree to the guidelines outlined in the Developer License Agreement.\r\n\r\n##General Instructions\r\n\r\n###Authentication Requirements\r\nHow to get credentials and API keys…\r\n\r\n###Security and Authentication Steps…\r\nHow credentials are passed to the web server…\r\n\r\n###Error Handling…\r\n\r\n###Rate Limiting Information…\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
